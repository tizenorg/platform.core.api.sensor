 * @brief The @ref CAPI_SYSTEM_SENSOR_MODULE API provides functions to start/stop sensors  and receive sensor information.
 *
 * @section CAPI_SYSTEM_SENSOR_MODULE_HEADER Required Header
 *   \#include <sensor.h>
 *
 * @section CAPI_SYSTEM_SENSOR_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * This Sensor API provides functions to  make use of sensors in the
 * device.  A variety of hardware sensors are typically available on
 * mobile devices.
 *
 * @section CAPI_SYSTEM_SENSOR_MODULE_FEATURE Related Features
 * This API is related with the following features:\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.accelerometer\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.barometer\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.gyroscope\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.magnetometer\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.photometer\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.proximity\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.tiltmeter\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.ultraviolet\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.temperature\n

 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.linear_acceleration\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.rotation_vector\n
 *  - http://tizen.org/feature/sensor.gravity\n
 *
 * It is recommended to design feature related codes in your application for reliability.\n
 *
 * You can check if a devrice supports the related features for this API by using @ref CAPI_SYSTEM_SYSTEM_INFO_MODULE, thereby controlling the procedure of your application.\n
 *
 * To ensure your application is only running on the device with specific features, please define the features in your manifest file using the manifest editor in the SDK.\n
